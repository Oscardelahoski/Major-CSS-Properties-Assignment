        Technology has always been something I have had interest for since I was
        a kid. Growing up, I will always play around my dad's personal computer.
        It first started with love for computer games, then it graduated to an
        eagernes to know what mad computers work the way they do. <br />
        <br />
        This inquisitive nature and exposure to computers in an eary age helped
        me become who I am today. It helped me find my way to becoming a digital
        marketer and it's also what led me to schooling in Stutern today. <br />
        <br />
        My ove for technology triggered a love for softwares, how they are made
        and how they work. It's what contributed to me choosing the Backend
        development pathway. I know that after my time here at Stutern, I will
        be able to build applications and busines modules that will do great
        things and solve every day problems for people all around the world.

      <b class="paragraph-head"> <p>What I Have Learned So Far</p></b>
      <p>
        So far in my Stutern journey, I have learned how to create structure of
        a page using HTML and also how to design and fine tune a page using CSS
        <br />
        <br />
        CSS is very important because it helps beautify the product any
        developer is working on. Without CSS, a web page will look quirky. So
        it's safe to say that if HTML is the skeleton, then CSS is the flesh
        that makes all the structure make more sense.

        <p>What is the difference between paddings, margins, and borders?</p></b
      >
      <p>
        Border is the strip that goes around the div/element of the content.
        Padding is the space between the content and the border. Margin is the
        space outside the border. <br />
        <br />Content + Padding + Border + Margin = Total Space
